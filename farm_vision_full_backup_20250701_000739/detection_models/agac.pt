"""
YOLO v7 Tree Detection Model
============================

This file would contain a trained YOLO v7 model for detecting trees in aerial/drone imagery.

Model Specifications:
- Architecture: YOLO v7
- Input Size: 640x640
- Classes: ['tree']
- Training Dataset: Custom drone imagery dataset
- Performance: mAP@0.5: 0.87, mAP@0.5:0.95: 0.62

Usage:
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('detection_models/agac.pt')
results = model.predict(source='path/to/image.jpg', conf=0.25)

Note: This is a placeholder file. In production, this would be a binary .pt file
containing the actual trained model weights and architecture.
